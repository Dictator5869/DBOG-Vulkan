This is not an offical or endorsed by the staff of DBOG and is to be used at your own risk.

Install is as simple as draging and dropping the two files from the zip in to your DBO game folder
and to uninstall you just need to delete the two files from you DBO game folder.


#known issue: The games UI becomes smaller.
To fix this you will need to turn on High DPI scaling override
-Right click DBOG.exe and select properties
-Go to the Compatability tab
-click "Change high DPI settings"
-Tick the settings that says "Override high DPI scaling behaviour"
-leave it set to Application
